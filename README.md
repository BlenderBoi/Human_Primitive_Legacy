Human Primitive is a Addon that adds Human Base Mesh and tedious or commonly use Human Body Parts as Primitive into the Add Mesh Menu. 



The purpose of the addon is to add Simple Human / Human Parts as a Primitive, so this is not a highly customizable Human Maker, instead this is a Simple Human Mesh Primitive, focusing on lower poly models, with different detail level / topology style to start from.
